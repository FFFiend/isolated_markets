# Note on reproducibility (working with main_islands.dta)
As per the original paper's author's README file, the main_islands.dta file was the main file used to 
produce all regression tables and figures. This file is too large to upload to GitHub however (around 170MB, GitHub has a limit of 100MB) and so unfortunately, one would have to manually download this file to begin reproducing.

Here are the steps to follow:
- Navigate to https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20200863 and click on Replication Package
- Click on download project, sign in and unzip the folder locally.
You should now have access and can begin working with the ```main_islands.dta``` file.
